## Project Plan Execution and Approach

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Setup Phase**: Established robust tooling foundation (Vite, TypeScript, testing, linting)
2. **Core Game Phase**: Built game engine and physics system
3. **UI Phase**: Implemented game components and hooks
4. **Store Phase**: Set up Zustand for state management
5. **Testing Phase**: Implemented unit tests for core functions and components
6. **Documentation Phase**: Comprehensive README and deployment preparation

### Core Features Implemented
- âœ… **Ping-pong game**: HTML5 Canvas with TypeScript and React
- âœ… **Score counter**: Real-time score tracking with visual display  
- âœ… **Ball traces**: Fading trail effect with scaling and opacity
- âœ… **Multiple difficulty levels**: Easy, Medium, Hard with different ball speeds
- âœ… **Leaderboard**: Match history with localStorage persistence

### Architecture Decisions vs. Original Plan

**State Management Evolution**: 
- **Planned**: Basic React state for scores and game status
- **Implemented**: Zustand for global state management - better performance for frequent game updates and cleaner architecture

**Game Loop Implementation**:
- **Planned**: Simple `useGameLoop` with requestAnimationFrame
- **Implemented**: Sophisticated loop with FPS capping (60fps) and delta time management for consistent performance

**Collision System**:
- **Planned**: Basic ball-wall and ball-paddle collision
- **Implemented**: Advanced collision with deflection angles based on paddle hit position, creating more dynamic gameplay

### Technical Architecture Decisions

**Game Engine Pattern**: 
Exceeded plan scope by creating a dedicated `GameEngine` class instead of inline collision logic. This provided:
- Better testability and separation of concerns
- Easier debugging and maintenance  
- Foundation for future AI opponent implementation

**Custom Hooks Architecture**: 
- `useGameLogic` - Core game state updates and engine integration
- `useGameLoop` - 60fps animation loop with requestAnimationFrame
- `useKeyboard` - Comprehensive keyboard input handling with event cleanup
- `useLeaderBoard` - Persistent game history with localStorage abstraction
- `useGameStore` - Zustand state management for global game state

**Component Structure**: 
Followed planned modular approach with enhanced organization:
- **Core Layer**: Game engine and utilities
- **Store Layer**: Zustand state management  
- **Hooks Layer**: Reusable game logic
- **UI Layer**: React components with clear responsibilities

### Performance Optimizations Beyond Plan
- **Trail Rendering**: Optimized with selective rendering based on trail length to maintain 60fps
- **Canvas Management**: Efficient clearing and redrawing strategies
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners and animation frames
- **State Updates**: Memoized callbacks to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Plan Deviations and Improvements

**Scoring System Enhancement**:
- **Planned**: Simple 10-point win with 2-point lead
- **Implemented**: Configurable 5-point matches for faster gameplay and better user experience

**UI Components Enhancement**:
- **Planned**: Basic modals and controls
- **Implemented**: Comprehensive modal system with form validation, difficulty selection, and detailed control instructions

**Testing Approach**:
- **Planned**: Unit tests for core functions
- **Implemented**: Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure with Vitest, though full test coverage remains for future iteration

### Accessibility Implementation
- âœ… Keyboard-only gameplay (W/S and Arrow keys)
- âœ… Focus styles and clear button labeling
- âœ… Game instructions and control hints
- ðŸ”„ ARIA announcements for score changes (planned for next iteration)

### What I Would Add With More Time
- **Enhanced Testing**: Complete unit test coverage for game engine and components
- **AI opponent**: Single-player mode with different AI difficulty levels
- **Sound system**: Ball bounce, paddle hit, and scoring audio effects
- **Online multiplayer**: WebSocket-based real-time multiplayer
- **Accessibility improvements**: Screen reader support and ARIA live regions
